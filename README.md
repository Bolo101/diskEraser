# Disk Eraser - Secure Disk Wiping and Formatting Tool  

**Disk Eraser** is a tool for securely erasing data from hard drives or USB keys, while also providing the option to format the disk with a chosen file system (EXT4, NTFS, or VFAT). It can erase multiple disks in parallel, ensuring thorough data wiping with multiple overwrite passes.  

The tool operates with pre-selected confirmation and formatting options, requiring no further interaction from the user once the erasure process begins.  

The project is designed to run inside a Docker container, as a bootable ISO, directly as Python code, or as a Linux command stored in `/usr/local/bin` under the name `diskeraser`.  

---

## Features  

- **List Available Disks**: Displays all detected disks for easy selection and allows the user to erase one or more disks.  
- **Secure Erase**: Uses multiple passes of random data followed by a final zero pass to prevent data recovery.  
- **Parallel Erasure**: Uses multi-threading to erase multiple disks simultaneously, optimizing performance.  
- **Automatic Partitioning**: Configures the disk with a single partition after erasure.  
- **Flexible Formatting**: Supports NTFS, EXT4, or VFAT file systems.  
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Erasure and formatting options are pre-selected, eliminating the need for user input during execution.  
- **Docker Support**: Runs securely in a containerized environment.  
- **Bootable ISO**: Can be converted into a bootable ISO for standalone operation.  
- **Command Line Utility**: Can be installed as a Linux command (`diskeraser`) for ease of use.  
- **Configurable Erase Passes**: Users can specify the number of overwrite passes (default is 6).  
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Logs errors, including permission issues and failed disk operations.  
- **Automatic Disk Verification**: Confirms the integrity of the disk after the erasure process.  
- **Root Privilege Check**: Ensures the tool runs with proper administrative permissions to prevent incomplete operations.

## Prerequisites  

- **Root privileges** (required for disk access).  
- **Docker** (if running inside a container).  
- **GCC Compiler** (if compiling the C version).  
- **Basic disk management knowledge**, as the tool **permanently erases data**.

## Installation and Usage  

### Using Direct Python Code  

1. **Download the repository**:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bolo101/diskEraser.git
```
2. **Execute code**:

```bash
cd diskEraser/code/python
sudo python3 main.py
```

### Install as a Linux Command (`diskeraser`)

1. **Copy the scripts to `/usr/local/bin`**:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/diskeraser
sudo cp diskEraser/code/python/*.py /usr/local/bin/diskeraser
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/diskeraser/main.py
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/diskeraser/main.py /usr/local/bin/diskeraser
```
2. **Run the tool**:

```bash
sudo diskeraser
```
This allows you to execute the tool as a simple command from anywhere on your system.

### Using C compiled code

1. **Navigate to the C code directory**:

```bash
cd diskEraser/code/c
```

2. **Compile the program**:

```bash
gcc -o disk_tool main.c disk_erase.c disk_partition.c disk_format.c utils.c -std=c11
```

This will generate the executable file named `disk_tool`.

3. **Run the tool**:

```bash
sudo ./disk_tool
```

- The program will display the available disks and prompt you to select one for erasure.

- It will also ask you to choose a file system for formatting (EXT4, NTFS, or VFAT).

- The number of random data passes is fixed to 6 by default.

4. **Move the compiled binary to a convenient location (optional)**:

```bash
sudo mv disk_tool /usr/local/bin/disk_tool
```

Now, you can execute the program from anywhere using:

```bash
sudo ./disk_tool
```   

### Using with Docker

You can also deploy a Docker container to use the disks eraser tool. If Docker is not install on your system, you can execute the **installDocker.sh** script on a Debian based system. 
[Install Docker Script](https://github.com/Bolo101/Qemu.sh)

For other distributions please access the Docker download page.

#### Version 2.3 (New Version)

1. **Pull the latest Docker image**:

```bash
docker pull zkbolo/diskeraser-v2.3:latest
```

2. **Run the Docker Image with Necessary Privileges**:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --privileged zkbolo/diskeraser-v2.3:latest
```

3. **Follow the interactive instructions inside the container to select and erase one or more disks**:

- The tool will list all available disks, allow you to select which ones to erase, and confirm before starting the erasure process.

- You will also be prompted to choose a file system (EXT4, NTFS, or VFAT) after erasure.

### Using the Bootable ISO

1. **Create the ISO**: Use the provided Bash script in the project to generate a bootable ISO file:

```bash
cd diskEraser/iso && chmod +x forgeIso.sh && sudo bash forgeIso.sh
```

If you prefer not to build the ISO yourself, you can download the pre-built ISO files for your system from the following links:

- [Download the latest version of the ISO (version 2.1)](https://archive.org/details/diskeraser-v2.1)
- [Download the previous version of the ISO (version 1)](https://archive.org/details/diskeraser)

These ISO files are ready to be flashed to a USB key and used for bootable operations.

---

2. **Flash the ISO to a USB key**: Use a tool like `dd` or `Rufus`:

With a terminal to forge USB using **dd** command
```bash
sudo dd if=secure_disk_eraser.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
```

3. **Boot from the USB key**:

- Configure your BIOS/UEFI to boot from the USB key.

- Follow the on-screen instructions to use the tool, select the disks to erase, and choose a file system for formatting.

## Command Line Options

When running the project directly in Python or via Docker, you can provide arguments to automate certain steps:

**Select file system**:

- `-f ext4`: Format the disk with the EXT4 file system.
- `-f ntfs`: Format the disk with the NTFS file system.
- `-f vfat`: Format the disk with the VFAT file system.

### Example:

```bash
python3 main.py -f ext4
```

This will erase the selected disk(s), then format it using the EXT4 file system.

## Notes

- **Disk Safety**: The tool **permanently erases** data from the selected disks. Make sure you have backups of any important data before proceeding.
- **Root Access**: Ensure you are running the program with sufficient privileges to access and modify disks (i.e., root or `sudo`).
- **Non-Interactive Operation**: Once the erasure process begins, no further user interaction is required. All confirmation prompts and formatting options are selected beforehand.
- **Small Disks**: If you are erasing very small disks, the tool may skip partitioning or formatting operations if the disk is too small to handle them.
